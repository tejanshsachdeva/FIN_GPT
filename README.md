   git clone https://github.com/tejanshsachdeva/fin-gpt.git
   cd fin-gpt
   ```
2. **Install the required dependencies**:

## Data Sources

The application uses official press releases and budget documents for the years 2023 and 2024. These documents should be placed in the `pdfs` directory in PDF format.

## How It Works

1. The application loads and processes the PDF documents containing budget information.
2. It creates vector and summary indices for efficient querying.
3. An AI agent is initialized with specialized tools for answering budget-related questions.
4. Users can input questions through the Streamlit chat interface.
5. The AI agent processes the questions and provides relevant answers using the prepared indices.

## Customization

You can customize the following aspects of the application:

- **OpenAI models**: Adjust the models used for summary, Q&A, and embeddings (modify the constants at the beginning of the script).
- **System prompt**: Change the `system_prompt` in the `load_agent` function to modify how the AI agent responds.
- **Tools**: Add more tools or modify existing ones to enhance the agent's capabilities.
